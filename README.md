# School_District_Analysis Challenge
UCB Data Analytics - Anaconda - Pandas and Python
# Questions and Data Analysis
# After removing the reading and math scores, answer the following questions:
# How is the district summary affected?
## R: Very minimal impact to the school district one point reduction overall
# How is the school summary affected?
## R: Summary records are impacted very little
# How does removing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance, relative to the other schools?
## R: It is impacting severely Thomas High School as this is dropping to 5 bottom, allowing another school to come ton top with similar grades 
# How does removing the ninth-grade scores affect the Math and Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type?  
## R: Again the impact is only to Thomas HS other schools and summary reports are showing minimal impact by one point. This can tell us that due to the data being so similar on others taking Thomas HS it is not making a big impact to the overall information.

To answer the questions above, you will need to repeat some of the steps you did during the module:

Recreate the district and school summary DataFrames.

Recalculate the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools.

Recalculate the average math score received by students in each grade level at each school.

Recalculate the average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school.

Recalculate the school performance based on the spending per student.

Recalculate the school performance based on the size of the school.

Recalculate the school performance based on the type of school.
